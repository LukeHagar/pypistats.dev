    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        What is the source of the download data?
    </h3>
    <p>
        PyPI provides download records as a publicly available dataset on Google's BigQuery. You can access the data with a Google Cloud account <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/the-psf:pypi.downloads">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        When is the website data updated?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The data update begins at 01:00:00 UTC and should take less than 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why are there so many more downloads after July 26, 2018?
    </h3>
    <p>
        PyPI download records are generated by a service known as <a href="https://github.com/pypa/linehaul">linehaul</a>. The previous iteration of the service had an issue which caused it to restart regularly due to running out of memory, resulting in a large quantity of dropped download records. On July 26, a newer version of the service was deployed, which is much more robust and reliable.

    <h3>
        Why are the cumulative download counts different from the sum of the downloads from the <i>overall</i> chart?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The cumulative download counts consider only the download records which are not from a known set of PyPI mirror applications, namely <code>bandersnatch</code>, <code>z3c.pypimirror</code>, <code>Artifactory</code>, and <code>devpi</code>. In other words, the cumulative download counts take the sum of the downloads from the <i>Without_mirrors</i> dataset from the chart.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why disregard mirrors from aggregated data?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The intent of disregarding mirrors is to provide metrics that reflect end-user download aggregation.
