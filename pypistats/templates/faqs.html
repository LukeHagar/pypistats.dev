    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        What is the source of the download data?
    </h3>
    <p>
        PyPI provides download records as a publicly available dataset on Google's BigQuery. You can access the data
        with a Google Cloud account <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/the-psf:pypi.downloads">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
        When is the website data updated?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The data update begins at 01:00:00 UTC and should take less than 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why are there so many more downloads after July 26, 2018?
    </h3>
    <p>
        PyPI download records are generated by a service known as <a
            href="https://github.com/pypa/linehaul">linehaul</a>. The previous iteration of the service had an issue
        which caused it to restart regularly due to running out of memory, resulting in a large quantity of dropped
        download records. On July 26, a newer version of the service was deployed, which is much more robust and
        reliable.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why are the cumulative download counts different from the sum of the downloads from the <i>overall</i> chart?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The cumulative download counts consider only the download records which are not from a known set of PyPI mirror
        applications, namely <code>bandersnatch</code>, <code>z3c.pypimirror</code>, <code>Artifactory</code>, and
        <code>devpi</code>. In other words, the cumulative download counts take the sum of the downloads from the <i>Without_Mirrors</i>
        dataset from the chart.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What is the difference between <i>Without_Mirrors</i> and <i>With_Mirrors</i>?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <i>With_Mirrors</i> and <i>Without_Mirrors</i> are not mutually exclusive sets of download counts like the 
        other segmentations provided. In fact, the <i>Without_Mirrors</i> downloads are a subset of the downloads in 
        <i>With_Mirrors</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some entities will create a mirror, or clone, of the PyPI repository using a tool like <code>bandersnatch</code>
        for the sake of security or availability. This means that their mirror repository regularly syncs with PyPI by 
        downloading all of the Python packages available. Those downloads are recorded by PyPI with <code>bandersnatch</code> 
        as the user-agent. pypistats.org filters downloads from known mirrors from the version and system segmentations on 
        the website. You will see also that on days in which you release a new version of your package there will be many 
        more downloads from mirrors, as active mirrors will sync with PyPI by downloading those new releases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The existence of mirrors means that the downloads provided by PyPI and BigQuery add uncertainty to the actual 
        usage of Python packages. One might expect that mirrors will mask end-user downloads for more commonly used 
        packages while simultaneously inflating the download counts of less common ones. We can't really be sure because 
        the mirrors don't report subsequent downloads back to PyPI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Downloads by mirrors are intentionally excluded from download breakdowns on pypistats.org because they do not 
        represent end-users of the software. Instead, they serve as an alternative provider to other end-users on a 
        separate (sometimes private) network.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can, however, assume that PyPI serves a significant proportion of the Python community's packaging downloads. 
        Hopefully significant enough that the quantities provided here are relevant to package maintainers and 
        representative of their users. There are other distributors like Conda which also serve python packages, but 
        their download data is not available like PyPI's as far as I'm aware, and thus are not incorporated in this website.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why disregard mirrors from aggregated data?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The intent of disregarding mirrors is to provide metrics that reflect end-user download aggregation.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What about downloads due to CI/CD tools?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Downloads from CI/CD tools are included in all metrics. There is currently no easy way to attribute downloads to
        deployment tools.
